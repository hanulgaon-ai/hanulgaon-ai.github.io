          <div class="answer">
            INITIALLY, I SPENT THE MOST TIME EXPLORING DETAILED INFORMATION
            THROUGH MOUSE SCROLLING AFTER THE INITIAL LOADING FINISHED. I SPENT
            TIME HOVERING THE MOUSE OVER OR MOVING IT TO INFORMATION I WANTED,
            WHICH PROVIDED CLEAR INFORMATION RECOGNITION THROUGH MOUSE HOVERING
            (E.G., WHEN THE MOUSE BECOMES A LARGE CIRCLE WITH A PLAY INDICATION,
            CLICKING PROVIDES DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT THAT CONTENT). I SPENT
            THE MOST TIME WITH THE MOUSE INTERACTIONS THAT INTERACTED WITH
            IMAGES (VIDEOS).

          <div class="answer">
            I CONTINUOUSLY OBSERVED THE TEXT AND IMAGES (VIDEOS) THAT INTERACTED
            WITH THE MOUSE WHILE SCROLLING AND MOVING THE CURSOR. PARTICULARLY,
            THE WHITE LINES OR WHITE CIRCLES THAT APPEARED WHEN HOVERING OR
            MOVING THE MOUSE MADE THE INTERACTION PROCESS MUCH MORE ENJOYABLE.

          <div class="answer">
            I THINK IT PROVIDED AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPLORE NEW WAYS OF OBSERVING
            INFORMATION OR EFFECTIVELY DELIVERING DESIRED INFORMATION. IN
            PARTICULAR, INFORMATION DELIVERY THROUGH INTERACTION SEEMS TO HAVE
            THE POWER TO IMPRINT INFORMATION ON USERS MORE EFFECTIVELY THAN
            TRADITIONAL METHODS OF JUST READING, WRITING, OR READING ALOUD.

            GOAL?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            IN RICH BROWN'S WEB PROJECT, THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE THROUGH THE
            MOUSE SEEMS TO BE HIGHLY VALUED. RATHER THAN INTERACTIONS THAT ARE
            SIMPLY DISPLAYED, IT SEEMS THAT INTERACTIONS THAT ONLY OCCUR WHEN
            THE USER ACTIVELY MOVES ENCOURAGE EXPLORATION OF THE WEB PROJECT'S
            INFORMATION.

        <div class="question-block" id="q7">
          <div class="question">
            7) WHAT IS YOUR IMPRESSION OF HOW THE EXPERIENCE SHOULD BE
            INTERACTED WITH OVER TIME? (FOR HOW LONG AND HOW MANY DIFFERENT
            TIMES)
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            I THINK THE SITE SHOULD BE VISITED MULTIPLE TIMES. ON THE FIRST
            VISIT, I TEND TO FOCUS ON THE NOTICEABLE INTERACTIONS. ESPECIALLY
            WITH MOUSE-RELATED INTERACTIONS LIKE HOVERING, DRAGGING, AND IMAGES
            (VIDEOS) & TEXT THAT INTERACT BASED ON MOUSE POSITION BEING SO
            EYE-CATCHING, I FIRST EXPLORE VARIOUS MOVEMENTS AND FOCUS ON
            INTERACTIONS. ON THE SECOND VISIT, I CAN FOCUS MORE ON EXPLORING
            INFORMATION USING THE NOW-FAMILIAR INTERACTIONS, AND ON THE THIRD
            VISIT, I CAN COLLECT INFORMATION I MIGHT HAVE MISSED.

            8) HOW DOES THE INTERACTIVE EXPERIENCE COMMUNICATE HOW IT SHOULD BE
            INTERACTED WITH OVER TIME?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            THE SITE DOESN'T EXPLICITLY DISPLAY MESSAGES LIKE "USE IT THIS WAY"
            OR "VISIT AGAIN LATER," BUT BY ARRANGING EXPLANATORY TEXTS TO
            CONTINUE DOWNWARD FROM THE FIRST SCREEN, IT NATURALLY GUIDES USERS
            TO SCROLL DOWN. IT ALSO MAKES USERS RECOGNIZE WHICH PARTS ARE
            INTERACTIVE THROUGH MOUSE HOVERING AND SHOWS A SCROLLBAR ON THE LEFT
            TO HELP GAUGE HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE. BY LISTING
            INFORMATION IN A TABLE OF CONTENTS FORMAT, IT GUIDES USERS TO
            COLLECT ONLY THE INFORMATION THEY WANT. THIS SEEMS TO BE A METHOD
            FOR USERS TO REVISIT WHEN THEY NEED ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IN THE
            FUTURE.

            RICH BROWN'S WEB PROJECT FEELS LIKE WATCHING A SHORT FILM THAT PLAYS
            ON REPEAT, LIKE A CONTINUOUSLY LOOPING FILM. THIS FILM INCLUDES
            CONTENT THAT EVOKES RICH BROWN'S INFORMATION, ALLOWING USERS TO
            IMAGINE THE CONTENT BEFORE READING THE TEXT. IT SEEMS TO BE A FORMAT
            THAT SUGGESTS AND DELIVERS INFORMATION TO USERS MORE DEFINITIVELY
            THAN TEXT DELIVERY.

          <div class="answer">
            RICH BROWN'S WEB PROJECT GIVES USERS CHOICES. IT ENCOURAGES USERS TO
            ACTIVELY EXPLORE INFORMATION DIRECTLY THROUGH VARIOUS INTERACTIONS
            WHILE ENJOYING MOUSE INTERACTIONS, RATHER THAN JUST PASSIVELY
            APPRECIATING. BEYOND TEXT AND INTERACTIONS, IT ALSO CREATES
            CURIOSITY AND ENCOURAGES MOUSE HOVERING THROUGH CONTINUOUSLY
            DISPLAYED VIDEOS.

          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            THIS WEBSITE FELT LIKE VIEWING A PROFESSIONAL PORTFOLIO. IT WAS A
            WEB PROJECT THAT HIGHLIGHTED THE CREATOR'S PERSONALITY AND
            SENSIBILITY, AND THIS SITE CREATES CURIOSITY AND NUMEROUS
            INSPIRATIONS FOR USERS. IT GUIDES USERS TO SELECT AND CURIOUSLY
            EXPLORE RATHER THAN COLLECTING INFORMATION THROUGH CONVENTIONAL
            READING. TO PREVENT A STIFF OR BLOCKED FEELING, IT ADDS INTERACTIONS
            TO TEXT AND IMAGES (VIDEOS) WITH EVERY MOUSE MOVEMENT AND SCROLL,
            MAKING THEM MOVE NATURALLY.

            12) WHAT IS THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THE INTERACTION TO YOU AND
            WHAT MAKES THAT PART FRUSTRATING?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            THE MOST FRUSTRATING PART OF THE INTERACTION WAS THAT, AT FIRST, I
            DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO SCROLL DOWN AND JUST STARED AT THE MAIN
            SCREEN. HAVING ENCOUNTERED THIS SITE WITHOUT PRIOR KNOWLEDGE, I WAS
            JUST CURIOUS ABOUT THE MOUSE INTERACTION AND DIDN'T THINK TO
            IMMEDIATELY LOOK FOR INFORMATION. ALSO, THE DESIGN OF ADDITIONAL
            MENUS THAT CAN BE OPENED THROUGH MOUSE HOVERING IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT
            IS SOMEWHAT DISAPPOINTING. THERE ARE MENUS WITH HYPERLINKS THAT CAN
            DIRECTLY MOVE TO INDIVIDUAL HOMEPAGES, BUT THERE IS INSUFFICIENT
            INFORMATION ABOUT WHAT THESE TEXTS EXPLAIN. THEY ARE IN
            ABBREVIATIONS THAT ONLY THOSE WHO KNOW WOULD UNDERSTAND; EVEN IF
            THEY HAD BEEN EXPRESSED WITH ICONS, THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN BETTER
            SIGNPOSTS. I ONLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT THE TEXTS WERE TALKING ABOUT AFTER
            CLICKING ON ALL OF THEM.

            13) WHAT IS THE MOST SATISFYING PART OF THE INTERACTION TO YOU AND
            WHAT MAKES THAT PART SATISFYING?
          </div>
          <div class="answer">
            THE MOST SATISFYING PART OF THE INTERACTION WAS, FIRST AND FOREMOST,
            THAT INTERACTIONS WERE ADDED TO BOTH MOUSE AND SCROLL ACTIONS. IN
            PARTICULAR, THE TRANSITIONS FELT SMOOTH AND NATURAL, ADDING
            INTERACTIONS TO EACH USER ACTION, WHICH INDUCED CURIOSITY IN USERS
            AND MADE IT EASY TO IDENTIFY AT A GLANCE WHICH PARTS ARE INTERACTIVE
            AND WHICH ARE NOT, MAKING THE WEBSITE EASY TO EXPLORE.
