    The title "Silent Trajectory" reflects the concept of users experiencing a quiet yet meaningful cosmic journey.
    It symbolizes the focused learning experience in the serene vastness of space, where silence enhances concentration.
    This name was chosen to evoke the dual nature of a cosmic journey through space and a focused study session.

    'Space Mono' font maintains consistency with the cosmic theme through its typography.
    The monospace font creates a technical/futuristic feel while also providing uniform letter spacing,
    which improves readability and helps maintain focus during study sessions.
    This font choice was deliberate to support the cosmic aesthetic without being distracting.

      The main title "Silent Trajectory" emphasizes the concept of a quiet yet purposeful journey.

    The cosmic-themed timer integrates with the space concept while providing practical functionality.
    Both stopwatch and countdown modes accommodate different study techniques like Pomodoro method.
    This feature was added based on personal experience with focus techniques, where time tracking
    enhances productivity without breaking immersion in the cosmic environment.

      The media player section is the central focus of the application, designed to create
      a fully immersive space-themed visualization that responds to the audio.
      The canvas element provides a dynamic cosmic environment that evolves with the music,
      helping users achieve deeper concentration through visual stimulation.
      
      The visualization design was inspired by the feeling of floating in space when hearing
      the ambient audio. The orbiting planets and stars create a mesmerizing yet non-distracting
      background that enhances focus rather than pulling attention away from study.

        Custom controls are designed to be minimally intrusive yet fully functional.
        In fullscreen mode, controls automatically hide after 3 seconds of inactivity
        to provide an uninterrupted cosmic experience, reappearing with mouse movement.
        This enhances focus while still maintaining accessibility to playback functions.
        
        The auto-hiding feature was implemented based on the observation that constant
        UI presence can be distracting during deep focus sessions, yet controls should
        be readily available when needed.
