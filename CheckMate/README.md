# CheckMate - Fair Roommate Living App

## Project Overview

**CheckMate** is a mobile-friendly web application designed to solve the common problem of unfair household chore distribution among roommates. The name combines "Checklist" and "Roommate" to represent our solution: a fair, transparent system for tracking household contributions and splitting living costs accordingly.

## The Problem

Living with roommates often leads to conflicts over household responsibilities. Some people do more cleaning, cooking, and maintenance than others, but everyone typically pays equal amounts for shared expenses. This creates resentment and disputes that can damage relationships and living situations.

## Our Solution

CheckMate introduces a **contribution-based cost sharing system** where:

- Daily household tasks are tracked through an easy-to-use checklist
- Each task has a weighted point value based on effort required
- Monthly living costs are split proportionally based on each person's contribution
- Higher contributors pay less, encouraging fair participation

## Features

### ðŸ“± Daily Task Tracking

- Simple tap-to-check interface for 8 common household tasks
- Color-coded system for three roommates (Red/Yellow/Green)
- Date navigation to view past and future days
- Visual highlighting to see individual contributions

### ðŸ“Š Monthly Statistics

- Comprehensive view of each person's contribution percentage
- Visual progress bars showing relative effort
- Month-by-month comparison capability
- Point-based scoring system with task weighting

### ðŸ’° Fair Payment Calculator

- Automatic calculation of individual payment amounts
- Transparent breakdown showing exactly what each person owes
- Inverse relationship: more work = less payment
- Customizable total monthly expenses input
- Built for Australian household budgets (default $3000 AUD)

## Technical Implementation

- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript
- **Storage**: Browser-based memory storage (no external database required)
- **Design**: Mobile-first responsive design optimized for touch interfaces
- **Compatibility**: Works on all modern mobile browsers

## How to Use

1. **Setup**: Open `index.html` in any web browser
2. **Daily Use**:
   - Select your name (Wonjun/Sejun/Changjo)
   - Complete household tasks and check them off
   - View highlights of your contributions by tapping your name
3. **Monthly Review**:
   - Check Statistics tab for contribution breakdown
   - Review Settlement tab for payment amounts
   - Adjust total monthly expenses as needed
   - Navigate between months to track progress

## Community of Practice Connection

This project directly addresses our **roommate community of practice** - a group of people who:

- Share common living space and responsibilities
- Have developed informal rules and expectations
- Learn from each other's household management approaches
- Need tools to facilitate fair cooperation

The app transforms implicit household negotiations into explicit, fair systems that benefit the entire community.

## Mycelial Creativity Aspect

Like mycelial networks that distribute resources based on contribution and need, CheckMate creates a **symbiotic living system** where:

- Individual actions benefit the entire household network
- Resource distribution (cost splitting) reflects actual contribution
- Transparent feedback loops encourage mutual support
- The system grows stronger as all participants engage

## Personal Reflection

As someone who has experienced the frustration of unequal household contribution, I built this app to solve a real problem in my living situation with Wonjun, Sejun, and Changjo. The development process involved:

1. **Problem Identification**: Recognizing patterns of conflict in our household
2. **Community Engagement**: Discussing the concept with my roommates
3. **Technical Development**: Building a solution that's actually usable
4. **Real-world Testing**: Implementing the system in our daily routine

The most interesting discovery was how making contributions visible changed behavior - people naturally became more engaged when they could see their impact on both the household and their wallet.

## Future Enhancements

- Real-time synchronization between multiple devices
- Customizable task lists for different household types
- Integration with expense tracking apps
- Photo verification for completed tasks
- Gamification elements to encourage participation
