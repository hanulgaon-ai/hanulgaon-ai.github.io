    BREATHING CONSTELLATIONS - HTML Structure
    Interactive Media Assignment - OART1013
    Student: Wonjun Kim (S3938263)
    
    Personal Story Context:
    As a child, I would lie on my back looking up at the countless stars in the night sky,
    wondering what would happen if I could draw lines between all those distant lights.
    As I grew older, I learned about constellations - those ancient patterns that humans
    have seen in the stars for thousands of years. I began creating my own constellations,
    connecting stars in ways that made sense to me.
    
    But I noticed something profound: constellations are temporary. The stars move,
    they fade, new ones appear. Each night offered a new canvas for imagination.
    I had to constantly create new personal constellations as the old ones disappeared.
    
    This assignment is born from that childhood memory - the joy of discovery,
    the acceptance of impermanence, and the endless possibility of creation.
    This interactive experience allows users to become cosmic architects,
    continuously creating new constellations in an ever-changing universe.
